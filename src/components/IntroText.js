        <p>Congratulations on your completion of Propel America's Medical Assistant (MA) pathway! As part of your preparation for entering the workforce with your new certification, we recommend that all fellows use a Gmail signature that communicates your credentials and your professionalism whenever you communicate via email. Your signature will contain the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your full name</li>
            <li>Your phone number</li>
            <li>A link to your LinkedIn page</li>
            <li>A photo of you</li>
            <li>A line indicating your new Certified Medical Assistant status</li>
        </ul>
